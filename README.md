# PriceList PWA

A simple Next.js PWA to list item prices, search/select items, and generate a quotation or invoice. Works offline using a service worker.

## Features
- Item catalog with search
- Select quantities and see a live subtotal
- Quotation and Invoice pages with print/save-to-PDF
- PWA: installable, offline support (static assets and pages)

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for state
- next-pwa for service worker

## Development
1. Install dependencies
2. Run the dev server at http://localhost:3000

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## PWA Notes
- Manifest lives at `public/manifest.json` and is linked via App Router metadata.
- Service worker is generated by `next-pwa` to `public/sw.js` during build.
- Offline fallback route is implemented at `/_offline` (see `src/app/_offline/page.tsx`). When offline and a page isn’t cached, the SW serves this page.
- Icons are required for installability. If you don’t have design assets yet, generate placeholders:

```powershell
npm run generate:icons
```

This creates `public/icons/icon-192.png` and `public/icons/icon-512.png`.

## Deploying to Vercel
This repo is ready for zero‑config deployment on Vercel. We include a minimal `vercel.json` and `.vercelignore`.

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. In Vercel, click “New Project” and import the repo.
3. Framework Preset: Next.js (auto-detected)
4. Build Command: `next build` (auto from `vercel.json`)
5. Output Directory: `.next` (Next.js default)
6. Environment Variables: add in Vercel Project Settings if needed.

Notes:
- We set response headers to avoid over‑caching the PWA service worker files (`/sw.js` and `/workbox-*.js`).
- If you see 404s for `icons/icon-192.png` or `icons/icon-512.png`, add those PNGs under `public/icons/`.
	- Alternatively, run `npm run generate:icons` to create placeholders.

## Testing (Vitest)
```powershell
npm test
```

## Notes
- Icons in `public/icons` are placeholders; replace `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` with your real PNGs for proper PWA install banners.
- Use the Quotation/Invoice page “Print / Save PDF” button to export.
 - Default currency is Kes (Kenyan Shilling). Adjust `formatMoney` in `src/lib/money.ts` if you need a different locale or currency.
